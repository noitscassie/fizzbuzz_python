# FizzBuzz in Python
This is a script to play the game [FizzBuzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) in Python. The exercise was carried out in order to gain some basic familiarity with the Python language before taking on the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) Week 9 [project](https://github.com/somemarsupials/cooking-challenge), a machine learning algorithm to categorise recipes.

### Running the program

To run this program, you will need to ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer.    
After downloading this repo, run `python run_fizzbuzz.py` to run the script in the command line.
